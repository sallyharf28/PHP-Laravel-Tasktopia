How it works?
----------------

Tasktopia was developed using PHP, laravel, HTML, PHP/MySQLi, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery/Ajax), and Bootstrap for the design. The source code is fully functional and easy to modify or enhance. Follow the instruction below to have an actual experience using this simple project.

Tasktopia allows for user creation exclusively by admin users. Admin users initiate the task creation process, providing essential details and references for the task. Admins are responsible for listing all the team members who will handle the task. Once a task is created, team members are granted access to view and add progress updates solely for the tasks they are assigned to. The admin reviews and assesses their activities to determine the task creation, progress & updates the task status accordingly in the system.

How to Run?
-------------
1. Download the source code and extract the zip file
2. Download or set up any local web server that runs PHP script, such as XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP.
3. Copy the extracted source code of the Laravel-PHP task management system to the appropriate location where your local web server can access it. For example, if you are using XAMPP, you can paste the source code in the 'htdocs' folder, which is usually located at 'C:\xampp\htdocs'.Open a web browser and browse the project. 
4. Install the required dependencies using a package manager like Composer. Open a command prompt or terminal in the extracted project directory and run the command: composer install 
5. Create a copy of the .env.example file and rename it to .env. Update the .env file with your local database settings, including the database name, username, and password.
6. Generate a new Laravel application key by running the command: php artisan key:generate
7. Create a new database in your local database server with the same name specified in the .env file ("laravel").
8. Migrate the database tables by running the command: php artisan migrate
9. Start the Laravel development server by running the command: php artisan serve
10. Open a web browser and access the Laravel project by browsing the  URL provided by the Laravel development server.
11. Use the provided email (naghamfakheraldine2002@gmail.com) and password (Naghouma321) to log in to the Laravel project.
